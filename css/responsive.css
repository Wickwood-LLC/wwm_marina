 * This is a boilerplate for customizing each display of a responsive
 * layout.  These will only work properly using the theme's default media
 * queries.  If you've made changes to the default settings, replace the
 * media queries found in this file with the ones generated inside of
 * sites/default/files/fusion/[theme-name].responsive.grid.css.
 *
 * Steps to activate responsive.css:
 * 1. Add your custom CSS to this file
 * 2. Rename this file to responsive.css
 * 3. Clear cached data at admin/settings/performance
